# -Pistop
Creating a little Raspberry Pi powered bus time tracker


# Project breakdown
### this will be broken down into various sub-sections and sections may be split or joined as the project progresses

* API
    * Access to the Lothian Buses API
    * Understanding the API and cherry picking the required data
    * parsing said data and feeding it to the required input

* Raspbery Pi
    * Display
        * Source Display - Potential 1st choice - [Waveshare 64 x 32 display](https://thepihut.com/products/rgb-full-colour-led-matrix-panel-4mm-pitch-64x32-pixels)
        * Work out power and connection requirements and get Pi and display communicating
    
    * Raspberry Pi
        * Figure out method of pushing parsed API data to display
        * Decide on method (Web page, Pytho etc.) 

    * Case
        * Figure out dimensions of case
        * Figure out placement of Pi, Power cables etc
